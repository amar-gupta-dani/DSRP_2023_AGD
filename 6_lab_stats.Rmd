```{r}
fortune_1000 <- read.csv('/Users/sandeep/Downloads/DSRP_2023_AGD/csv_files/Fortune_1000.csv')
big_fortune_1000 <- mutate(fortune_1000, prof_margin = profit/revenue * 100, reduced_revenue = revenue/1000)
companies_in_MN <- select(filter(big_fortune_1000, state == "MN"), company, prof_margin, state)

```

### Null Hypothesis: The profit margins of companies headquartered in Minnesota is equal to the profit margins of companies headquartered elsewhere in the U.S.

### Alternate Hypothesis: The profit margins of companies headquartered in Minnesota is less than the profit margins of companies headquartered elsewhere in the U.S.

```{r}
t.test(companies_in_MN$prof_margin, na.omit(companies_in_US$prof_margin))
```
